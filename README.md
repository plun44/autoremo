# autoremo
Bash script that allows you to remove all files with the same extension from a specified directory. Its pretty basic and im sure GitHub is full of them but im trying to document everything I'm learning.

- Install

    	git clone 'https://github.com/plun44/autoremo'

Or you can just paste the content of autoremo on a .sh file with nano or vim.

- Use

1. Enter the directory

			cd autoremo

2. Give the script execution permissions

			chmod +x autoremo.sh

3. Execute the script

			./autoremo.sh
